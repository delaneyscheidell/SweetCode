## Introduction
SweetCode is a web-based application that enables teachers to engage students in computer science lessons in the classroom. This platform offers coding challenges and lessons alike, allowing students to work through modules at a personalized pace. Teachers can assign tasks and view student submissions to facilitate class progress.

## Implementation
To develop this idea, we worked through the software engineering cycle to establish functional and non-functional requirements and constraints. We also created an Object Analysis Model, Subsystem Decomposition, and Deployment Diagram using UML. Finally, we performed a Mini-Scrum to implement specific features of this application.
